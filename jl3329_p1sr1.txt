Project 1 Status Report 1
This week, I met up with my group to complete our contract and 
to decide what we would do for our project.
We decided to use a dataset for 911 calls in Seattle, plotting points
on a map of Seattle corresponding to the location at which the call was made.
We decided to use different colored markers to determine what kind of call was made.
